# My_Ender_3_Pro & 3D printing Guide

so this a repository that will reduce your time and your efforts in order to make 3D modeles came to Life 
in this Repository i will help you make your 3D printing more Effective and share some problems that i have 
i will share here all the problem that i face ,, how i figure it out and how you sould work with your 3D printer the Ender-3-pro 

# General introduction 


3D printing is a so-called additive manufacturing technique which proceeds by adding material, unlike techniques proceeding by removing material,
such as machining. 3D printing makes it possible to produce everyday objects, spare parts or even prototypes intended for testing. 
The starting point is a computer file representing the object in three dimensions, broken down into slices. 
This information is sent to a 3D printer which will carry out the manufacturing by adding successive layers.

# 3D Printer History

It was on July 16, 1984 that the first patent on 3D printing (known as “additive manufacturing”) was issued.
deposit. The agents are French: Jean-Claude André, Olivier de Witte, and Alain le
Méhaute on behalf of CILAS ALCATEL. The same year, in the United States,
on August 1, 1984, the American Chuck Hull filed the patent on the technique
stereolithography 3D printing (SLA for StereoLithography Apparatus)

# Modeling and file export

The first step in 3d printing is to model a 3d object and export it to one of the
Stl specific files. obs. or amf. For this we must choose one of the many software
computer-aided design (CAD), such as SolidWorks, Catia, Autodesk Fusion
360...

# Slice the 3D object

After having a finished 3D model, you must then slice the file or cut the file into several
layers using one of the slicing software, Ultimaker Cura for example.
This software not only allows us to slice the 3d object but it must generate the g code as well
than controlling the different parameters of the machine.
G code is a machine tool command language that includes instructions for
piloting , is the language known by the majority of CNC machines.

# The impression

Once the g code is ready, you can print by sending the g code to the printer
usually by an SD card, a connection cable to the computer , by internet through
a local network or by OCTOPRINT for anywhere in the World . 

# Material deposition (FDM)

FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) or molten filament deposition. This is the type of printers
3D most common among individuals , This technique is the one  that we're focusing on because this technique is used for Our Ender-3-pro. 
This technique consists in depositing layer by layer
a filament of thermoplastic material melted on average at 200°C. Thus, by superimposing
layers which can have different contours and therefore by accumulation of material, we end up
to get the desired object. The print head moves in the three directions of space
identified by the three coordinates X, Y and Z (length, width and height). These coordinates
are transmitted from the computer by a 3D file which corresponds to the 3D model of the object to be
to print.

# First - adding OCTOPI 

will this is a great tool to have , so let's say you want to print something and you wanna to recored a video for the printing operation 
or you wnat just to launch a printing without going  next to your printer or you have some concern about your printing process and you want to supervised 
from another place , well OCTOPI make it easy to you
